Manual install on a Debian based system. (Other distributions will be
similar but may use different package managers.)

See if the libxxhash library is installed on your system. (probably not)

run:
locate libxxhash

Look for
libxxhash.so
libxxhash.so.0
libxxhash.0.42.0
under /usr/lib.

If it isn't installed, download source zip or tarball from:

https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases

(latest is xxHash v0.6.2 as of this writing)

Extract tarball to a temp directory.

cd {temp-directory}/xxHash-0.6.2/cmake_unofficial

run:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr {path-to}/{temp-directory}/cmake_unofficial/

( if cmake is not found, install cmake and re-run )
sudo apt-get install cmake
( depending on distribution, may need build-essential )
sudo apt-get install build-essential

Once cmake CMakeLists.txt completes, run;

make
make test
make install

( May need to: sudo make install )

At this point libxxhash.so should be installed in
/usr/lib/

To verify run:
sudo updatedb
locate libxxhash

Finally,
zef install Digest::xxHash
